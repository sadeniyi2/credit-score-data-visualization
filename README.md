# Credit Score Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, preparing, and visualizing credit-related and
socio-economic data to uncover patterns and distributions using exploratory data
analysis (EDA) techniques.

The scope of this project is strictly **data visualization and exploration**.
No predictive modeling or machine learning is performed.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset was uploaded and analyzed using Google Colab
- Contains numeric and categorical features related to credit and socio-economic factors
- Data was cleaned before visualization to ensure accuracy and consistency

> Note: Raw data may be excluded or replaced with a processed version due to sensitivity.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)
- Trimmed whitespace from text-based columns
- Removed duplicate records
- Converted relevant columns to numeric data types
- Inspected missing values across the dataset

The cleaned dataset was exported for reproducibility and further analysis.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
EDA was conducted to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.  
Visualizations include:
- Histogram-based distribution analysis
- Basic statistical exploration
- Identification of trends and irregularities in numeric features

All generated plots are saved in the `reports/figures` directory.
